In recent decades, the term ‘gentrification’ has circulated in the mainstream. The term encompasses a variety of phenomena from shifting neighbourhood aesthetics, to the rhetoric surrounding ‘revitalisation’ of dilapidated city-spaces and displacement of marginalised communities (Pell, 2014). One of the catalysts for these phenomena is short-term rental platforms. Airbnb in particular has significantly reshaped housing that its impact has colloquially been termed the ‘Airbnb effect’ in economics. In short, the term describes Airbnb’s impact on cities around the world: reduced housing supply and higher rent prices (Chaudhary, 2021). So, despite Airbnb’s lucrativeness , its systematic widening of rent gaps accelerates gentrification – or ‘Airbnbification’ – by pricing out long-time residents and small businesses (Wachsmuth and Weisler, 2018; Peters, 2016; Rozena and Lees, 2021). 

Airbnb's lack of accountability has pervaded the London housing market since its arrival in the city in 2009. Whether through displacing minorities or accelerating rent spikes, the platform has destabilised housing in much of London. Moreover, Airbnb has contributed to rapid gentrification. Airbnb’s reputed ‘affordable’ short-term stays effectively displace long-term residents and businesses (Chen, 2021). 

Deprivation data at the LSOA level, and 2019 and 2022 data from InsideAirbnb, a non-profit organisation that provides real-time data of Airbnbs in cities across the globe, served as the basis for this analysis. And, in light of Airbnb’s wide scale impact on London, this report turns to specific boroughs to extrapolate from the nuance of the platform’s presence in the city. Those boroughs are: Camden, Hackney, and Kensington and Chelsea. These boroughs were selected due to their differences in geographic location, population, and having a similar number of Airbnbs
