## Intro 

The unregulated and unaccountable nature of AirBnb has inflicted severe damage on the residents of Great Britain. Whether it be through increasingly displacing minorities, steeply rising rent, or the number of evictions that areas of high deprivation have faced, these factors contribute to the inability for the British public to safely secure housing and enrich the dynamicity of London. Moreover, Airbnb has contributed to rapid gentrification, as exemplified through increased presence in Hackney. Through Airbnb listing's attractivness of providing a low price short term stay, long-term residents and hotel buisnesses are being thrust out of their rightful communities(Chen, 2021). Why is Airbnb a negative venture for London? Airbnb guests often contribute to antisocial behavior, fragment communities through their transient nature, and cause rent prices to rise.  Prior to 2015, it was required of British people who wanted to let their whole home’ on a short-term basis needed to apply for planning permission for change of use (Airbnb, 2023). Failure to do so could have led to fines of up to £20,000(GuestReady’s Hosting Blog, 2022). Of these listings, 23 per cent, or 18,577, of these are thought to be in breach of a legal 90-day limit in the capital(Temperton, 2020) Following the deregulation of Airbnb’s in Great Britain after 2015, there is a notable reduction in the supply of houses for long-term residents, eliminating the ability for many people to truly establish themselves in the Greater London area. This, paired with the GLA 2020 report which found that between 2015 and 2019 there has been a fourfold increase in Airbnb listings in London alone(GLA Housing and Land, 2020). Simple as, the more Airbnb’s on the London market, the more homes are off the market for Londers who seek to remain, work, and study in London becomes intangible. Londoners of all socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds deserve to have a fair ability to live in London, and the continued deregulation of Airbnb is a disservice to those very people. 
## Pen Portraits
Considering the unique situation of each borough when considering facets of social, economic, and demographic data, it is crucial to provide a closer look as to what is going on in London’s boroughs. Therefore, it was decided that Camden, Kensington, and Tower Hamlets would receive a pen portrait each to properly illustrate how AirBnb is affecting these diverse areas. By looking within these boroughs, a lot can be revealed about what effect AirBnb is having on each respective borough. For instance, Camden council data reveals that of the 7,100 whole properties listed on platforms such as Airbnb and Booking.com in 2019, a staggering 48 per cent exceeded the 90-day legal limit. Camden council currently has 6,000 families on its housing waiting list, meaning 6,000 families who currently reside in the UK, but are unable to access a standard of well-being (Temperton 2020). For effective policy change to take place, it is important to properly characterize the true impact that Airbnb has had on the housing market.
## Data
The data utilized in this report specifically focuses on the boroughs of Camden, Kensington, and Tower Hamlets, as well as the Greater London area. Airbnb data representing 2019 and 2022 both come from InsideAirbnb, a non-profit open source organization that provides real-time data of Airbnb’s across global cities. The boroughs chosen are representative of varying levels of deprivation with Camden having a middle mix of high and low levels of deprivation, while Kensington has love levels of deprivation, and Tower Hamlets representing a more deprived borough(Ministry of Housing 2019). Deprivation data was taken from the Office of National Statistics (Ethnic groups by borough, n.d). The eviction data has been collected by the Ministry of Justice (Mortgage and landlord possessions actions, boroughs n.d). What we term “eviction data” in reality includes a variety of property repossession actions by landlords and on the basis of failure to pay one’s mortgage. However, this likely does not capture the entire picture of evictions since many individuals living under informal arrangements might be evicted through unofficial channels.

The boroughs of Camden, Hackney, and Kensington & Chelsea were selected to be analyzed in-depth due to their differences in geographic location, population, and levels of deprivation. Below are profiles of the aforementioned boroughs which provide context of their current states. When taking into consideration the impact of Airbnb's business model on these boroughs, it is helpful to understand their social fabrics so that feasible policy suggestions can be put forth.

### Camden 

The London Borough of Camden is located in central London. According to census data from 2020, the borough has a total population of 263,000 individuals (Office of National Statistics, 2020). The borough’s population is majority White, and has a substantial number of individuals who identify as ‘Mixed/Other’. A specific breakdown can be seen below.

Demographic Statistics by Ethnic Group (Office of National Statistics, 2020): <br /> 
* White: 155,000 (~59%)
* Asian: 34,000 (~13%)
* Black: 29,000 (~11%)
* Mixed/Other: 45,000 (~17%)

Regarding levels of ‘deprivation’, as judged by the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government (MHCLG), Camden has a Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) rank of X out of X and a housing score of X, which is middle (?) of the London boroughs  (2019)

### Hackney
The London Borough of Hackney is located east of Camden, separated only by the borough of Islington. According to census data from 2020, the borough has a total population of 289,000 individuals (Office of National Statistics, 2020). Hackney, like the other two boroughs being analyzed, has a majority White population. However, it has a relatively small population of those who identify as ‘Asian’ and larger numbers of ‘Black’ and ‘Mixed/Other’ individuals.  

Demographic Statistics by Ethnic Group (Census Data, 2020): <br /> 
* White: 167,000 (~58%)
* Asian: 19,000 (~7%)
* Black: 49,000 (~17%)
* Mixed/Other: 53,000 (~18%)

Regarding levels of ‘deprivation’, MHCLG, Hackney has a IMD rank of X out of X and a housing score of X, which is middle (?) of the London boroughs  (2019)

### Kensington & Chelsea 
The Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea is located west of both Camden and Hackney. According to census data from 2020, the borough has a total population of 153,000 individuals, making it markedly smaller than the other two areas being analyzed (Office of National Statistics, 2020). Kensington & Chelsea have a much higher proportion of White individuals living in the borough, which points to the more privileged status and larger incomes being obtained by local households.

Demographic Statistics by Ethnic Group (Census Data, 2020): <br/> 
* White: 109,000 (~71%)
* Asian: 15,000 (~10%)
* Black: 14,000 (~9%)
* Mixed/Other: 15,000 (~10%)

The Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea has an IMD rank of X out of X and a housing score of X, which is middle (?) of the London boroughs  (MHCLG, 2019)

## Policy Recommendations 
As the current government reviews possible policy iniatives to regulate short-term listings thrphysical checks of premises to ensure regulations in areas including health and safety, noise and antisocial behavior are obeyed, these considerations are not aimed at mitigating the profound impact of gentrification on London communities. Wide sweeping efforts should be put in place to protect minority communities who are a vibrant part of London, and are more likely to face evictions. Therefore, through increasing regulations and limitations on Airbnb, in conjunction with providing greater housing protection of native-Londoners, it is certain that not only will Airbnb guests receive a higher standard of housing, but also, rightful dwellers of London are protected. 
Compared to other cities across the globe dealing with the challenges of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, the London’s policy currently in place is relatively lax. In London, the only regulation on units listed on Airbnb is that they are capped at being rented out for 90 days of the year, and no permit registration is necessary. Other European cities, like Amsterdam and Barcelona, have stricter requirements. In Amsterdam, the maximum number of guests allowed in one rental is four, units can only be rented out for 60 days of the year, the owner of the unit must be living there for at least 6 months of the rental cycle, and safety precautions must be provided. Barcelona has taken restrictions a step further in that no new short-term rental permits are being issued for any property in the Old Town area. Therefore, it is recommended that greater provisions are made available to minority communities, particularly in zones that contain patterns of gentrification such as Hackney. Similarly, as demonstrated through spatial analysis, the government should take concrete efforts towards scaling back the ratio of Airbnb listings available in comparison to living places for long term residents.
